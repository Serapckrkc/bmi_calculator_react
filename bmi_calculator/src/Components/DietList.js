        <h3>Don't Forget Your Breakfast!</h3>
        <p>
          {" "}
          Your body wakes up hungry and needs energy. Eating breakfast helps
          meet your energy needs. Eating breakfast will help you increase your
          energy and keep you fit throughout the day. Healthy breakfast choices:</p>

            <li>Feta cheese, olives, whole wheat bread, tea, coffee, milk or juice</li>
            <li>Breakfast cereal with low-fat milk or a glass of juice (use a product high in fiber but low in sugar, fat, and salt)</li> 
            <li>Boiled eggs or omelet, cheese, whole grain bread and tea, coffee or freshly squeezed juice</li>
            <li>Oat flakes with low-fat milk and fresh or dried fruit</li>
        

        <h3>Consume Your Meals Regularly!</h3>
        <p>
          Try to make sure you have three main meals each day and healthy snacks
          between meals when you are hungry. You can choose the following as
          healthy snacks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>fruit-fresh, dried, frozen</li>
          <li>yogurt or milk</li>
          <li>dairy desserts such as rice pudding or pudding</li>
          <li>milk and breakfast cereal</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Try to Prefer Foods High in Iron!</h3>
        <p>
          Iron helps to make hemoglobin in the blood. Hemoglobin is in red blood
          cells and carries oxygen throughout the body. If there is iron
          deficiency in your diet, the level of hemoglobin in the blood
          decreases and anemia may occur. This makes you feel tired.
        </p>

        <p>
          Foods high in iron will increase the amount of iron you need daily,
          both in the main and snacks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Red meat such as beef and lamb</li>
          <li>Whole grain bread</li>
          <li>
             Green vegetables; such as zucchini, green beans, broccoli, lettuce
          </li>
          <li>dried fruits; such as dried apricots, raisins</li>
          <li>Nuts; such as hazelnuts, walnuts, almonds.</li>
          <li>Legumes; such as beans, lentils, chickpeas.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Consume Plenty of Liquids!</h3>
        <p>
          Loss of fluid in the body occurs more easily than you think. When you
          feel thirsty, your body has lost some water. Aim for 6-8 glasses of
          fluid consumption throughout the day to prevent dehydration in the
          body. Try to drink more fluids when the weather is hot or when you do
          sports.
        </p>

        <h3>Alternatives for fluid consumption;</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>That</li>
          <li>Mineral water</li>
          <li>Semi-skimmed milk</li>
          <li>Kefir, buttermilk</li>
          <li>Soups</li>
          <li>Freshly squeezed juice</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Losing fluid in your body while doing sports can cause a decrease in
          your performance and fatigue. To avoid this, remember to drink plenty
          of fluids before, during and after an activity such as sports or
          training. It is not necessary to consume sports or energy drinks while
          doing physical activity. Water and freshly squeezed juices help you
          meet your body's fluid needs and give you energy.
